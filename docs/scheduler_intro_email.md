Hello Yalu, 

Thank you for offering to beta-test this scheduling software!  If it looks helpful, I would be happy to support your use of it at Bigelow, since that will show me ways to improve it!

I appended to this message a brief description of the app.  However, I've also set up a sample classroom and invited you to register for the site as its scheduler; you can always try things out like that and just refer to the below explanations when needed.


Cheers,

MW

PS here is that description...

Basically the app has two main functions (and correspondingly, tasks for the users):

(i) set up classroom and register users
(ii) collect worktime preferences, generate and maintain schedule

Classroom setup
---------------

User registration is by invite only.  Each user gets registered under one or more "roles".  I have set up a sample classroom and invited you to register as its scheduler.  You then invite the parents and teachers in your classroom to register as well.

To register people as parents, you as scheduler load the classroom detail page.  You then click "add a child"; enter a nickname (e.g., first name and last initial) for that child plus the email addresses of their parents.  The site then sends to those addresses invites similar to the one you got, except that the resulting users will instead get linked that child as parents, and correspondingly affiliated to the child's classroom as well.  (Since you are already registered, when you attach your email to your own child's nickname, your account will be affiliated to that child as parent automatically without generating an invite email.)

The procedure is similar for registering teachers (on the classroom detail page, you click "add a teacher" and enter their Bigelow email address "teachersof...@gmail.com").

Scheduling
----------

As you know, worktime scheduling at Bigelow goes roughly like this:

1. collect shift preferences, ranked 1-3 for each child in the classroom
2a. assign shifts to parents
2b. assign parents to particular instances of their shifts

The scheduler usually breaks the year down into three four-month "periods", and the above procedure gets repeated for each period.

Finally I'll describe how the site supports this workflow---but it may be easier instead to try it out on the site yourself with the given sample classroom (just load the periods listing page; the earlier period shows what things look like for scheduling already finished, the later one shows what things look like once parents have all submitted preferences).

To build a worktime schedule, you first create a period by entering appropriate dates, and activate its "solicit preferences" toggle button.  The parents can then enter or edit (corresponding to their child) their worktime shift preferences for that period.  I will set things up so that preferences from any previous period in the same classroom just get carried over (unless the parents want to change them).

You can see the submitted preferences at the period detail page.  Once you've collected all preferences (it helps to set a deadline), you click the link to configure a search for an assignment of shifts to parents (2a above).  This page tells you whether there is any way to assign all parents some one or other of their #1 ranked shifts.  If there is, you just click through to see a list of those.  If not, you can click on the "+" button next to a given shift to add for some child any of their #2 or worse ranked shifts.  (This function actually subdivides shifts by "offset": if a child has two duties per month, then the site assigns them to every other occurrence of a shift, and you can choose whether this starts in the first or second week; similarly if a child has just one duty per month then there are four possible offsets.)

Once you have a satisfiable set of options for each parent, you'll see a link to generate all possible assignments of shifts to parents.  You pick one of these, and click "commit".  This generates the full schedule (2b above), which you can review and edit either under the period detail page, or under the calendar page.  As things stand, the site may sometimes generate nine commitments in a period for some parents; you can either drop one of these yourself, or invite them to do it themselves through the site.  If for some reason you don't like the resulting schedule, the period detail page has an option "clear schedule for period" which simply deletes all commitments and lets you start the process over from the same set of preferences.

Cheers,

Max
