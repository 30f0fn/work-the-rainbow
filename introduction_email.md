Hello everyone,

Yay it's time for another round of worktime scheduling!

We decided to try another approach this time.  We put up a website, 

www.worktherainbow.org.

Its main functions are

- collecting people's shift preferences for each period
- helping the scheduler assign shifts
- circulating the assignments to parents and teachers
- letting you change your assignments
- collecting the teachers' confirmation that you showed up
- circulating random Bigelow-related information.

Site access is by invitation.  You should get an invite email today (if you don't see it by 4pm, please check your spam filter!).  You can then establish your site account either using your Google identity or by submitting a username and password.*

Once you've logged in, please navigate to your child's profile page (linked from their first name in the navigation bar).  From there please submit your shift preferences for this coming worktime period.**

We hope that in the long run this site simplifies worktime organization.  In the short term there will be some bugs and inefficiencies to be fixed.  If you find any of these or if you have suggestions for improvement or extra features, please let us know!

Best wishes,

Max & Julia

In any case, the worktherainbow site records from Google *only* your Gmail address, and does not store your Google authentication or other personal data.  (Instead it gets certification from Google that Google has authenticated you.)
