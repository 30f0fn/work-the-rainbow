Dear Little Rainbow parents,

Yay it's time for another round of worktime scheduling!

We decided to try another approach.  We put up a website, 

www.worktherainbow.org.

Its main functions are

- collecting people's shift preferences
- assigning shifts 
- circulating the assignments
- letting you change your assignments
- marking that you showed up
- posting other Bigelow dates.

You should get an invite email today (if you don't see it by 4pm, please check your spam filter!).  You can then establish your site account either using your Google identity or by submitting a username and password.^[*,**]

Once you've logged in, please navigate to your child's profile page (linked from their first name in the navigation bar).  From there please submit your shift preferences for this coming worktime period (May-August).  We would appreciate it if would submit your preferences by Monday, 22 April.

We hope that in the long run this site simplifies worktime organization.  In the short term there will be some bugs and inefficiencies to be fixed.  If you find any of these or if you have suggestions for improvement or more features, please let us know!

Best wishes,

Max & Julia

* If you do not want to use a Google account but would like to use your Facebook, Twitter, Baidu or whatever account please let Max know and he will try to set it up.  In any case, the worktherainbow site records from Google *only* your Gmail address, and does not store your Google authentication or other personal data.  (Instead it gets certification from Google that Google has authenticated you.)  Naturally the site does store scheduling info as well as your contact info; access to any of this requires authentication per invite from the scheduler or site admin; and invites are extended only to parents/guardians of children in Bigelow as well as relevant Bigelow staff (teachers).
