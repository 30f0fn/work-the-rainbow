teacher settings 

commitment change advance notice minimum is a number n of days such that
- if a commitment is more than n days away, you can reschedule it arbitrarily
- otherwise, the website will generate a commitment change request, to be accepted or rejected by any LRB teacher within regular LRB hours.
- all commitment changes will generate a message for Jodi



1. recording commitment completion
2. enforcing permission for shift changes



2.  The scheduling site lets people change their worktime commitments.  However, you plan according to expected worktimes.  So, we need a commitment change policy which doesn't disrupt your planning.

My sense is that the existing practice is that people verbally ask you if it's ok to change, and then alter the posted worktime schedule manually.

With web-based approach, we could maintain the same policy.  As a check to ensure people don't change without your notice, I can have the site give you a notice on your homepage whenever somebody changes their commitment.

One problem is that getting your permission requires you to give permission, which is a task you have to perform, and we want to minimize the burden of that task.

One proposal, then, is to impose a minimum number of days notice, so that only changes with fewer days notice require your permission.

We could now similarly request that people always get your permission before changing their worktimes.  Another option would be to hard-code a deadline for commitment changes, and then either ban all changes later than that, or require that the change gets your intervention.

For example, I could have the site generate for you a three-letter "commitment change permission token".  Any time somebody needs your permission to change, you give them this token and they punch it in.  Or, when somebody wants your permission to change, I could have the site give you a message
