<h1>worktime preferences</h1>

<p>Please submit your shift preferences here.  You must assign some numerical rank to at least {{min_shifts}} shifts.</p>

<p>After collecting everyone's preferences, we will try to assign everyone some highly ranked shift.  This is likelier to work if you rank multiple shifts highly.  So, please do that if you can!  Thank you.
</p>

<p>If you don't see a shift here, it's because the site doesn't know that your child is at Bigelow then. You can fix this from the child's profile page.
