Hello everyone,

Yay it's time for another round of worktime scheduling!

We decided to try another approach this time.  We put up a website, 

www.worktherainbow.org.

Here are its main functions:

- collect people's shift preferences for each period
- help the scheduler assign shifts
- circulate the assignments
- let you change assignments
- collect the teachers' confirmation that you showed up.

Site access is by invitation.  You should get an invite email this afternoon.  You can then set up your site account either using a Google account or by submitting your own username and password.*

Once you set up this account, please navigate to your child's profile page (recognizable by their first name), and from there please submit your shift preferences!**

The interface is pretty budget but maybe one day we will improve it.  Background color suggestion anyone?  There are some bugs and inefficiencies to be fixed.  If you find any of these or if you have suggestions for improvement or extra features please let us know!  Sorry in advance if there are any 

Best wishes,

Max & Julia

* If you do not want to use a Google account but would like to use your Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Beida or whatever account please let Max know and he will try to set it up.  In any case, the site does not store your Google authentication data but instead requests certification from Google that it finds you to be you.
